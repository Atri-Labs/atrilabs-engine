## Calcount4

A simple calorie tracker app made using the [Atri framework](https://github.com/Atri-Labs/atrilabs-engine) for Hacktoberfest'22

Select food items from the Dropdown menu and click the Add button to add them to the table. The app updates the table with the content of calories and nutrients of the foods consumed during the day and also updates the graph with the total intake of nutrients and calories during the last 7 days.

Sources:
* Nutritional data of selected foods from https://www.webmd.com/diet/healthtool-food-calorie-counter
* Estimated calories for the different nutrients from https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Food-Calories
* Target daily intake of calories and nutrients estimated freely using inputs from https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a19537348/how-much-fat-and-carbs-should-you-eat/ and https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-many-calories-per-day#calculator
