Atri framework is a full-stack web development framework to build Progressive Web Apps.

- Frontend development: Use our visual editor to increase your productivity. You can also add your custom React code
- Backend development: Currently, we support Python for backend development. We are planning to add support for NodeJS soon. 
- Deployment support: Our CLI provides rich support for easy deployment at your platform of choice such as GitHub Pages, AWS, etc. 

## What can I build using this framework?

Atri is a general purpose framework that can be used to build everything from e-commerce websites to internal apps.
