# Contribute to Atri framework

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Atri framework. ðŸŽ‰

This page will give you a quick overview of how to get involved.

## Table of contents

1. [Issues and bug reports](#issues-and-bug-reports)
2. [Contributing to the code base](#contributing-to-the-code-base)

## Issues and bug reports

First, [do a quick search](https://github.com/Atri-Labs/atrilabs-engine/issues)
to see if the issue has already been reported. If so, it's often better to just
leave a comment on an existing issue, rather than creating a new one. Old issues
also often include helpful tips and solutions to common problems.

If you're looking for help with your code, consider posting a question on the
[GitHub Discussions board](https://github.com/Atri-Labs/atrilabs-engine/discussions).

### How to submit an issue?

When submitting an issue, please include the following:

- descriptive title
- your **environment** (operating system, Python version, Atri version)
- issue label (refer [labels](https://github.com/Atri-Labs/atrilabs-engine/labels) for an overview of how we tag our issues and pull requests.)
- Video or GIF to further explain the issue (optional)

## Contributing to the code base

Please review the [existing issues](<(https://github.com/Atri-Labs/atrilabs-engine/issues)>), pick the one that you are interested in working on and ask the admins to assign that issue to you.

If you are a newcomer, you can consider getting started with ["good first issues"](https://github.com/Atri-Labs/atrilabs-engine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

### Pull Requests

A pull request should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. You will need `npm >= 8.11.0 `, `node >= v16.16.0` and `yarn >= 1.22.18`.

**Ask before submitting a pull request** by creating an issue. The feature/refactored code etc. might not be aligned with current goals of the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/atrilabs-engine.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd atrilabs-engine
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Atri-Labs/atrilabs-engine.git
   ```

2. The initial installation of `node_modules` and building all packages is a bit tricky and will be simplified once we migrate from `lerna` to `turborepo` soon. You might have to install lerna by running `npm i -g lerna` in a shell. Similary, you might have to install yarn by running `npm i -g yarn` in a shell.

   ```
   # install node_modules
   yarn install

   # store project root directory to make installation easy
   export PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)

   # build some pre-requisite package
   cd $PROJECT_ROOT/packages/forest && yarn run build
   cd $PROJECT_ROOT/packages/core && yarn run build
   cd $PROJECT_ROOT/packages/scripts && yarn run build

   # delete the node_modules folder in project root directory
   rm -rf $PROJECT_ROOT/node_modules

   # bootstrap the project
   lerna bootstrap

   # build all packages
   lerna run build

   # run again (because of known issue with lerna)
   lerna run build
   ```

3. Start the development server

   Run the following commands in a shell:

   ```
   cd $PROJECT_ROOT/packages/webapp-builder
   yarn run server
   ```

   Open another shell and run the following:

   ```
   cd $PROJECT_ROOT/packages/webapp-builder
   yarn run start
   ```

   This will launch the visual editor in `http://localhost:4000`.

4. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

5. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to contain your feature, change or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

6. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

7. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream main
   ```

8. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

9. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
   with a clear title and description.

### Cutting a release

1. Tag all merged pull requests that go into the release with the relevant milestone. Each merged PR should also be labeled with one of the labels name `tag: ...` to indicate what kind of change it is. Make sure all the breaking changes are correctly labelled with `tag: breaking change`.

2. Close the milestone and create a new one for the next release.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project
owners to license your work under the terms of the [GPL v3.0 License](https://github.com/Atri-Labs/atrilabs-engine/blob/main/LICENSE).
